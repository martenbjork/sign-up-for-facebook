    <h1>Sign up for Facebook</h1>

    <p class="intro">Facebook is the world's largest social network. Before you sign up, make sure you know what information they store about
      you and how it can be used.</p>

    <h2>Facebook will attempt to</h2>

      </li>
      <li>Track much of what you do on the internet
        <a class="source" href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/06/making-ads-better-and-giving-people-more-control-over-the-ads-they-see/">Source</a>
      </li>
      <li>Log most of what you do on Facebook

    <h2>With this data, Facebook may be able to</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="primary-info">
          Guess where you live, work and spend your time
        </p>
        <div class="secondary-info">
          <p>Facebook will collect location information related to you. When putting this data together, it can create a detailed
            map of where you spend your days. Not every single moment, but in general. Facebook encourages you to share your
            location in different ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Facebook explicitly asks you to share where you live and work.</li>
            <li>They encourage you to share your current location in various parts of the app.</li>
            <li>They encourage you to “like” and review local businesses.</li>
            <li>If a Facebook friend tags you in a post with location information, your profile will be attached to that location.</li>
            <li>Facebook stores your IP address whenever you use the service. This gives them a good idea of where you are. IP
              addresses by themselves do not give a precise location, but if another Facebook user posted a location-tagged
              post from the same IP address (i.e. same Wifi), Facebook can connect the dots and know your location more precisely.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Facebook is built on the concept of “friends”. To interact with other people on the platform, you add them as
              friends.

            </li>
            <li>When you chat with someone, “like” someone's post or join the same group as someone, Facebook will infer that
              you are likely to be friends.
              <a class="source" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/www/336320879782850">”Where do People You May Know suggestions come from?” </a>
            </li>
            <li>Facebook uses design tricks to make you upload your phone's contact list. Even if you decline, they use tricky
              wording to make you do it anyway.

            </li>
            <li>Since Facebook tracks its users' location data, they has the
              <u>ability</u> to guess who your friends are based on the time you spend together at the same locations.

        <div class="secondary-info">
          <ul>
            <li>Facebook users can add their relationship status and information about who their partner is.</li>
            <li>Facebook encourages it's users to use the service to create invitations to parties and other events. When you
              accept an invitation, Facebook can assume that you will be spending time with the other attendees.</li>
            <li>Your Facebook friends can “tag” you in posts when you're at restaurants, events etc. even if you do not share
              this information yourself.</li>
            <li>Since couples are likely to connect to Facebook from the same IP address every, it can be used to predict who's
              dating who.
            </li>
            <li>Similarly, since Facebook tracks each user's location, they can find out when two friends are at the same location.

            <li>Facebook can estimate where you live, what you're interested in and who you meet with. They can also infer your

            Facebook show the ads to the people who are most likely to be interested in them. Since Facebook knows so much
            about their users, they are good at showing the right ads to the right people.

              It's considered a problem for democracies since people don't see the same ads and therefore won't be able to have a discussion
